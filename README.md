# AI-Powered-Automated-Multilingual-WordPress-WPML-ACF-n8n-
A lightweight experimental workflow for automatically translating WordPress posts using WPML, ACF, n8n, and AI. Extracts ACF fields, translates only text fields with LLMs, rebuilds the final structure, and creates/updates translated posts via REST API. Currently single-post; designed to expand into multi-post automated loops.
